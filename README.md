# Sorting
Within my process of the code was able to incorporate a option method than making all the algorithms go at once since it might conflict with the other code that does sort. Can say my code is not exacutable from how a bit confused I was to make the structure work together. Did understand how each algorithm had a different assortment in sorting but found it difficult to incorporate an external file than an array from how a different method towards entering numbers to be ordered. To which some sorting has some errors by how some were able to implement the external file but wasn't able to trasnfer it to some from how the use of if is needed with an int than a string.
